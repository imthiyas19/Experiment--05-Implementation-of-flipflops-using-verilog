### THEORY 
SR Flip-Flop
SR flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, SR latch operates with enable signal. The circuit diagram of SR flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has two inputs S & R and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of SR flipflop is similar to SR Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable.
The following table shows the state table of SR flip-flop.

Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, SR flip-flop can be used for one of these three functions such as Hold, Reset & Set based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of SR flip-flop.
Present Inputs	Present State	Next State

By using three variable K-Map, we can get the simplified expression for next state, Qt+1t+1. The three variable K-Map for next state, Qt+1t+1 is shown in the following figure.

The maximum possible groupings of adjacent ones are already shown in the figure. Therefore, the simplified expression for next state Qt+1t+1 is
Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)


### D Flip-Flop
D flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, D latch operates with enable signal. That means, the output of D flip-flop is insensitive to the changes in the input, D except for active transition of the clock signal. The circuit diagram of D flip-flop is shown in the following figure.
 
This circuit has single input D and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of D flip-flop is similar to D Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable.
The following table shows the state table of D flip-flop.

Therefore, D flip-flop always Hold the information, which is available on data input, D of earlier positive transition of clock signal. From the above state table, we can directly write the next state equation as
Qt+1t+1 = D

Next state of D flip-flop is always equal to data input, D for every positive transition of the clock signal. Hence, D flip-flops can be used in registers, shift registers and some of the counters.


### JK Flip-Flop
JK flip-flop is the modified version of SR flip-flop. It operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. The circuit diagram of JK flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has two inputs J & K and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of JK flip-flop is similar to SR flip-flop. Here, we considered the inputs of SR flip-flop as S = J Qtt’ and R = KQtt in order to utilize the modified SR flip-flop for 4 combinations of inputs.
The following table shows the state table of JK flip-flop.

Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, JK flip-flop can be used for one of these four functions such as Hold, Reset, Set & Complement of present state based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of JK flip-flop.
Present Inputs	Present State	Next State

By using three variable K-Map, we can get the simplified expression for next state, Qt+1t+1. Three variable K-Map for next state, Qt+1t+1 is shown in the following figure.

The maximum possible groupings of adjacent ones are already shown in the figure. Therefore, the simplified expression for next state Qt+1t+1 is
Q(t+1)=JQ(t)′+K′Q(t)Q(t+1)=JQ(t)′+K′Q(t)



### T Flip-Flop
T flip-flop is the simplified version of JK flip-flop. It is obtained by connecting the same input ‘T’ to both inputs of JK flip-flop. It operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. The circuit diagram of T flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36288975/167911534-5f3c445d-bc68-46e2-9a9c-7efce5febc60.png)



This circuit has single input T and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of T flip-flop is same as that of JK flip-flop. Here, we considered the inputs of JK flip-flop as J = T and K = T in order to utilize the modified JK flip-flop for 2 combinations of inputs. So, we eliminated the other two combinations of J & K, for which those two values are complement to each other in T flip-flop.
The following table shows the state table of T flip-flop.



Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, T flip-flop can be used for one of these two functions such as Hold, & Complement of present state based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of T flip-flop.
Inputs	Present State	Next State

From the above characteristic table, we can directly write the next state equation as
Q(t+1)=T′Q(t)+TQ(t)′
⇒Q(t+1)=T⊕Q(t)
